A CLI to manage playlists and genearte playlists based on public databases.

## Structure and Inspiration

This project is totally inspired by [dynaconf](https://github.com/rochacbruno/dynaconf). If was not for Bruno Rocha that inspires me to study Python this would never had happened, of if would it would not be public!

Thanks!!!
